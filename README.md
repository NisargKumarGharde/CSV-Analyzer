# Project 1
# CSV-Analyzer
_A Python script created to help you get quick insights to your csv file._

Part of my college IIT Patna tied up with GUVI(HCL) internship.
Under the part of Data Science, this is the Problem Statement no. 50

## Setup and Requirements:
Use Python version (eg. Python 3.8+)

Install _pandas_ [Required] (copy from here for ease: _pip install pandas_)

_I already imported_ pandas _in my python script for you to read in your respective enviornment._

_I already imported_ os _in my python script for you to read in your respective enviornment._

## A guide on how to run my code:
1. It asks for an input, i.e your csv file
2. Enter the path of CSV file (copy from folder)
3. You will get the output as expected.

#### NOTE: This is a basic csv file analyzer and only the required output will be out that were asked to do.

## I hope the content above was able to provide you a glimpse of my project.
### Sorry in advance if any part of my project caused an issue.

# THANK YOU
